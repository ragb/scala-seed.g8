![travis ci](https://travis-ci.org/ragb/scala-seed.g8.svg?branch=2.12.x)

This is a [Giter8][g8] template for Scala

```
sbt new ragb/scala-seed.g8
```

Diferences from the canonical scala-seed:

* Use specs2 instead of scalatest
* Have scalacheck as a test dependency by default
* Recomended Scala Options (some of them a bit controverse) using sbt plugin.
* Use template variables
* sbt-git, sbt-scalafmt and sbt-headers plugin included by default
